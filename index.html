            <div id="article">
                <p>"I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. 'You shall not have a farthing
                    from
                    me,' I cried, on which he bowed and left the room without another word. "When he was gone I unlocked
                    my bureau,
                    made sure that my treasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I
                    started to go round the house to see that all was secure--a duty which I usually leave to Mary but
                    which
                    I thought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself at the
                    side
                    window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached. "'Tell me, dad,' said she,
                    looking, I thought, a little disturbed,
                    'did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?' "'Certainly not.'
                    "'She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to
                    see
                    someone, but I think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped.'
                    "'You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it. Are you sure that everything is
                    fastened?'
                    "'Quite sure, dad.'
                    "'Then, good-night.' I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again, where I was soon asleep.
                    "I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have any bearing upon the case, but
                    I
                    beg that you will question me upon any point which I do not make clear."
                    "On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid."
                    "I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be particularly so. I am not a very
                    heavy
                    sleeper, and the anxiety in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two
                    in
                    the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake,
                    but it
                    had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening
                    with
                    all my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the
                    next
                    room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my
                    dressing-room
                    door.
                    "'Arthur!' I screamed, 'you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that coronet?'
